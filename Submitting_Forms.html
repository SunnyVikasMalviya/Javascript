<!--
Their are two methods to submit forms.
The first one as mentioned is GET, and the other one is POST.
These methods are used to send data to the action page.
GET is not secure as it sends data through the url and the data can be easily seen by other users.
POST is a secure method that sends data without including it in the url.
